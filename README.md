# Theme Change

I have been spending a lot of time working on my portfolio website. I just wanted a break and do some coding. In my portfolio website, I am going to add a light/dark theme (not sure if I would add neon), but I wanted to practice the code and see how it works. So I made this project. 

Hope you like it :) 

Any feedback let me know.
